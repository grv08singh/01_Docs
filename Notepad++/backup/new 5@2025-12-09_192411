I am good at teaching mathematics to school students at the level of class 9, 10, 11, 12.
As a source of income, I want to teach kids online on youtube with free and subscription based content.
I want to make video lectures of step by step solutions to the mathematics syllabus.
Research and tell me which english speaking country, which education board and which class/grade students should I target for the same,
keep in mind that 
1) the target audience must be huge in numbers 
2) maximum part of this audience should come from a wealthy nation or background
3) for me, the competition should be as low as possible on youtube, meaning there should not be many tutors doing this same job
4) I want to provide 75% lectures free of cost so that people get to know my style of teaching first, 
and for remaining 25% lectures, I want to include in paid subscription to my channel.
